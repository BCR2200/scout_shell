# OVERVIEW

This is the shell designed for the scouting app to make it "easy" to create a new app for beginners.
It contains a solid foundation and a couple of examples to make it a smooth transition into coding in flutter.

The contents of the "shell" are primarily found in the lib folder/directory, where there is: 
A databasing folder (containing the necessary classes for the SQLite database and state management with provider) 
A shell folder (containing the general base of the app + custom widgets as well as an example tab that can be used) and
A main.dart file which is designed to easily integrate new pages into the app

There also are a couple of examples/hints in the pubspec.yaml file
